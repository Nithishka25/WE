        Harry returns to Hogwarts for his third year, where he learns that a dangerous prisoner named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison. The school is on high alert, and dementors—dark creatures that guard Azkaban—patrol the grounds, affecting Harry deeply. Harry discovers that Sirius was once believed to have betrayed his parents to Voldemort. As the story unfolds, Harry, Ron, and Hermione uncover the truth: Sirius is actually Harry’s godfather and was framed for the betrayal. They also meet the mysterious and magical creature called a Hippogriff and learn to use the Patronus charm to protect against dementors. With the help of a time-turner, Harry and Hermione save Sirius from capture and reveal the real traitor, Peter Pettigrew. The school year ends with new friendships and truths that change Harry’s understanding of his past. The book focuses on themes of loyalty, trust, and justice.
