        Harry enters his sixth year at Hogwarts as Voldemort’s power grows stronger in the wizarding world. Dumbledore begins giving Harry private lessons to uncover Voldemort’s past, especially the dark magic he used to become nearly immortal through Horcruxes. Meanwhile, Harry discovers an old Potions textbook filled with mysterious notes signed by the “Half-Blood Prince,” which helps him excel in class. Suspicious of Draco Malfoy’s secret activities, Harry tries to uncover his connection to the Death Eaters. As the truth about Voldemort’s Horcruxes is revealed, Harry and Dumbledore embark on a dangerous mission to retrieve one. Their return to Hogwarts ends in tragedy as Dumbledore is killed by Severus Snape, who is shockingly revealed to be the Half-Blood Prince. The book ends with Harry determined to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes. Themes of loyalty, loss, and the complexity of trust are deeply explored.
