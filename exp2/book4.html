        Harry returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year and unexpectedly becomes a competitor in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament. Despite being underage, Harry’s name is mysteriously entered into the magical Goblet of Fire, forcing him to face three difficult and life-threatening tasks. Alongside champions from other wizarding schools, Harry faces dragons, underwater challenges, and a magical maze. Throughout the tournament, Harry uncovers a dark plot involving the return of Lord Voldemort. In the final task, Harry is transported to a graveyard where Voldemort regains his full power and summons his followers. Harry narrowly escapes with the help of his parents’ spirits and returns to warn the wizarding world. The school is left in shock as Voldemort’s threat becomes real once again. The story explores themes of courage, friendship, and the struggle between good and evil.
