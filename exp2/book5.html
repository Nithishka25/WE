        Harry returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year amid growing fears about Voldemort’s return, which the magical government refuses to acknowledge. Harry and his friends face increased challenges as the Ministry of Magic appoints the strict Dolores Umbridge to control Hogwarts, making life difficult for students. To prepare for the looming threat, Harry forms a secret group called Dumbledore’s Army to teach his friends practical defense spells. Throughout the year, Harry struggles with feelings of isolation, anger, and the burden of his connection to Voldemort. The story builds to a dramatic battle at the Ministry of Magic, where Harry and his allies fight Death Eaters to protect a prophecy about Harry and Voldemort. The battle ends with the loss of a beloved mentor and the wizarding world finally accepting the dark threat. Themes of rebellion, friendship, and the fight for truth are central to this book.
